    <P>I think time of day tends to effect our tastes more than we acknowledge. Or even time of year - mental state all of those things. As I dig deeper into music/book/whatever discovery itâ€™s more likely that Ill be confronted with something unusual or out of the norm. What Im noticing is how *when* I come across these things I can imagine a time in which I am enjoying said thing? The thing that brought this up is iconoclasm by Buck-tick, a wild 90s rock song which smacked me in the face this morning at 8:30am. There's something so comical about being confronted in such a situation. Makes you take a step back and recognize the absurdity of life. But here I am listening to growls and rhythmic tappings  - knowing that I am getting nothing out of this. Maybe it is for the future? I lean towards that mode of thinking - most things  in the world are not "never" but rather "not yet" -and maybe I am around when that final check gets cashed.

<p> I've been playing banjo kazooie again - for the first time. Its a balance when playing a retro game you've no
    nostalgia for. It is immediately apparent how far we have come in just knowing how video games *should* be made. My thesis has been "old games have no respect for your time". Luckily I am playing the xbox live arcade version streamed through gamepass - so there is a little grace still available for me. I am wandering - more than I'd prefer, as the missions are foggy in their instructions. Older games love having you do things multiple times - with the forward progress only occurring on the 3rd attempt. Whats that all about? I don't have time for that. So I fly through the star 3 times, I climb the snow mans scarf, I race against boggy. I do the banjo AND the kazooie, but I am still wondering where to go. That doesn't ever change.

<h2>song progress - lenticular lenses</h2>
<p>
    I think the first line came up in the middle of the night - or the time right before bed. Trying to aim for something about point of view.
</p>
<ul class="lyrics">
    <li>I've got lenticular lenses</li>
    <li>I feel them twistin my neck</li>
    <li>a dollar to pop it</li>
    <li>a balloon that is stoppin</li>
</ul>
<P>and then something at the end - haven't found the last line yet</P>
