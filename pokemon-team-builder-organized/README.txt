This Pokemon Team Builder has been reorganized into separate files for better maintainability.

Files included:
- team-builder.html - Main HTML file
- css/team-builder.css - All styles
- js/app.js - Main application logic
- js/data/abilities.js - Abilities data
- js/data/pokemon.js - Pokemon data (placeholder)
- js/data/moves.js - Moves data (placeholder)
- js/components/ - Component modules (placeholders)
- js/utils/ - Utility functions (placeholders)

To use: Open team-builder.html in your browser

Note: The data files are still embedded in app.js for now since extracting them all
would create very large files. You can further separate them as needed.
